## CancelRX

Canvas currently supports sending prescription cancellation messages to pharmacies by navigating to the original command. This can be cumbersome. Additionally, responses are not readily accessible. 

To improve these workflows we have added the following:


**Cancel Prescription Command:** This new command allows a clinician to search past successful erx messages to select which past prescription should be cancelled. Each will show the name of the medication, the prescriber, and the date prescribed.

**Cancel Button within Medication Modal:** Prescriptions that can be cancelled will also have a cancel button within the medications modal. Clicking it will add the cancel prescription command, with the prescription pre-selected. 

**Status Indicators** The cancel prescription command and modal will display the status of both the cancellation request, as well as the original prescription. The original prescribe command will also update if successfully cancelled.
