### Next steps:
- Add some example content to give context to information architecture
- Develop 'useful guides' functionality
- Develop 'on this page' functionality
- Code Sample - Kristen to come back with preferred approach.
- Discuss how search and filters should function (ref https://customer.io for search/filter UI and functionality, see also ad-test doc for Angolia search)
- Release Notes feed is continuous list of all releases (asc). Note content block which precedes these notes. Look at RSS feed implementation. Need to add tags to release content for filtering / date filtering.
- Guides - Utilise same layout as SDK etc.
- Discuss styles generally, incorporate mobile responsiveness, font packages
