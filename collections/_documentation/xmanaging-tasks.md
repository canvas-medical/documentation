## Introduction to the Task Management Panel

To access the task panel in Canvas, navigate to the panel filter badge icons on the top right of the Schedule View and select the "Tasks" icon. By default, the task list displays open tasks assigned to you or your team, with any label, and created by anyone.

## Filters and Sorting

You can filter tasks by navigating to the Task header and applying filters such as assignee, status, creator, and label. For example, the assignee filter defaults to "Me or my teams," but can be changed to other staff, teams, or specific individuals. Users can also multi-select labels using the label filter. Keep in mind that when using the search function of the Label filter to multi-select labels, you'll need to scroll and click the checkboxes instead of searching and pressing enter.

To sort tasks, locate the task list column headers, which include Task, Patient, Follow-up due, Activity, Created, Assignee, Team, and Label. Click on the desired column heading once to sort tasks in ascending order and twice to sort them in descending order.

## Adding Activity

If you want to comment on a task, find the desired task in the Task List and click on the underlined "No Activity" or "# comment" within the Activity column. Type your comment in the Comment Box that opens, and click "Add Comment." All comments made on this task will be visible within the Comment Box. 

## Assigning Tasks to Individuals and Teams

To reassign a task to an individual, locate the desired task in the Task List, click on the current assignee within the Assignee column, and select the new assignee from the drop-down menu that appears. The task will then be added to the new assignee's task list.

To assign a task to a team, locate the desired task in the Task List, click on the current team within the Team column, and select the new team from the drop-down menu that appears. The task will then be added to the task list of all members in the selected team. This is useful when the task is relevant to multiple team members and doesn't need to be assigned to a specific individual.

## Linking Resources to Tasks

Users can attach resources to already created tasks, with a limit of 5 total resources per task. The task panel and patient chart task view now have functionality to add or view attached resources. For tasks with no attached resources, users can click the "no linked items" link to begin attaching resources. Note that uncommitted commands can be linked to tasks, giving users access to all commands within the patient chart, while entered in error commands will not be listed.

## Adding Labels

To label a task, locate the desired task in the Task List and click on the underlined "No labels" within the Labels column or next to an already existing label. Search for the appropriate label and select it from the drop-down menu. To create a custom label, navigate to the triple line menu on the top left-hand side, select "Settings," and then "Task Labels" under the "Practice" heading. Click on "Add Task +" and complete all fields in the template, then click "Save."

## Marking Tasks as Complete
 
To mark a task as complete or closed, find the desired task in the Task List and select "Done" when no additional work is left to be done, or select "Close." A completed or closed task message will appear, giving you the option to undo your action until the page is refreshed. After refreshing the page, the task will no longer be visible.
