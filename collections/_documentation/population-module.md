## Introduction {#h_01HDPDM13DXDRKQQ8ECDDWWP1T}

The population Module allows Canvas users to easily manage campaigns for protocols and keep track of specific patient populations. **This module is replaced by the [Campaigns](/documentation/campaigns-module) and [Patients Module](/documentation/patients-module) enhancement but can be enabled by the `populationsView` flag.** When enabled this flag disables access to the Campaigns Module. Please for assistance enabling this flag.
