Field-based care teams may often do rounds at facilities. Rather than having to enter the facility address manually for patients, you can create them here and then assign them to the patient in their profile. This ensures accuracy.

## Updating and Deleting Facilities

To edit a facility, click into an existing facility and make changes as needed. You can also take a bulk action to delete facilities by checking the boxes next to each and using delete in the action drop-down. 

{% include alert.html type="warning" content="Updating or deleting a facility will not change the records previously assigned to patients. Changes will only impact future changes." %}
