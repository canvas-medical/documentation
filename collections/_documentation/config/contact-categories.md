The Contact Categories dropdown provides customized flexibility for customers to input their desired values. While customers can input and delete contact category values at any time, power of attorney, emergency contact, and authorized for release of information are default values that cannot be removed as options from the dropdown list. 

Navigate to Contact Categories under the Practice section of your admin settings.
