You likely have a lot of tasks to address each day. Create custom labels to organize them better, and find them faster. Labels are tags that you can assign to your task based on different criteria, such as urgency, worfklow, or specialty. Instances are pre-configured with three labels: Emergent, Urgent, Routine.

## Adding task labels
To add a new task label, click ![add-task-label](/assets/images/add-task-label.png){:width="10%"} in the top right corner and then complete the following form. 

**Name:** This is what shows on the label. (i.e. Urgent, Primary Care, Referral, etc.)

**Color:** Choose from the dropdown to associate a color. If not selected, the label will be gray. 

**Position:** There is a search when adding labels, as well as the ability to scroll through a list. The position will determine the order in that list. 

**Task Association:** You can associate specific labels to automatically created tasks
