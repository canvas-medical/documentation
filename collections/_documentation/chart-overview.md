The patient chart is a collection of all the patient’s clinical elements that have been captured previously as part of the patient care. It includes notes that are taken as part of visits, asynchronous communications, messages, letters, results from labs or testing and more. As a Canvas user, here you’ll have quick access to previously documented essential information, the timeline where you will see a chronological view of all notes and the action panel on the right side of the chart that opens when you select to view items such as tasks, refills, and documents.
