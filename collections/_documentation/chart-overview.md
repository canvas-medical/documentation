title: "Chart Overview"
---

The patient chart represents a comprehensive digital collection of a patient's health information and includes all of the data captured during patient interactions. The Canvas chart was purpose built to help reduce the cognitive burden placed on clinicians. The three panel design allows for relevant data to be surfaced and/or easily accessible at the point of care. In this article, we will review how to navigate the chart and the functionality available within each of the following sections:

1. [Global Navigation](/documentation/chart-overview/#global-navigation)
2. Patient Card
3. Patient Summary
4. Patient Timeline
5. Chart Sidepanels
6. Canvas Chat
