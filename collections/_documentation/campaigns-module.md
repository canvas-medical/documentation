## Introduction {#h_01HDP5BK06QTEWHKTMZS3ST2EJ}

The Campaign Module allows users to start and manage outreach campaigns for specific protocols within Canvas. For example, users can start an outreach for all patients due for their Annual Wellness Exam, and keep track of completion rates. Previously this could only be done in the [Populations Module](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405414136595). The [Patients](/documentation/patients-module) and Campaigns Module enhancements will be replacing the [Populations Module](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405414136595).
