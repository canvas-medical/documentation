Canvas Remote allows users to upload images to Canvas through the use of QR codes. This is a HIPAA compliant workflow, as the application does not save the images to your device. This functionality is supported in the following workflows:

- Visual Exam Finding Command
- Patient Photo
- Insurance Card
- Patient ID Card

The application is available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canvas-remote/id1273841003). It is currently only available on iOS devices (iPhones & iPads). Once downloaded, you can find it on your device by searching Canvas. No log in is necessary to use the functionality, as it is dependent on access to the QR codes, which are behind your Canvas login. <br><br>
