## Change Document Type in Chart

### Introduction

From time to time you may realize an outside document has been classified incorrectly. You can easily reclassify the document right from the patient's chart.

### Step by Step

1. From the patient's chart, with the incorrectly classified document in view:
2. Select the arrow to expand the document
3. Select Edit to open the edit modal
   1. ![click-edit-on-clinical-document](/assets/images/click-edit-on-clinicial-document.png){:width="17%"}
4. Select Change Document Type
   1. ![change-document-type-modal](/assets/images/change-document-type-modal.png){:width="17%"}
5. Choose the new document type from the drop down menu
6. Re-enter the required fields for the new document type you selected. While some fields may be pre-populated, field re-entry is required because different document types require different data.
7. Select Ready for Clinical Review
