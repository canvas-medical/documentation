## Introduction {#h_01HDP9051Q4K1J3D0DFSGN2RQX}

The Patient Module is a top-level view in Canvas that displays all
patients in a table format. This list can be filtered by care team, so
that each care team member can easily access a list of all patients they
are responsible for. It can also be filtered by name and facility (if
relevant).

Each row is a patient and each column is a patient attribute (e.g. Care Team or Facility). The patient, facilities, and last seen columns can be selected to sort the list. The Patients and [Campaigns Module](/documentation/campaigns-module) enhancements will be replacing the [Populations Module](/documentation/populations-module).

### Navigating Patients Module {#h_01G4EMZQW1DBMNX39H4SFCF2AX}

Use the ![mceclip0.png](/assets/images/patients-module/triple-line.png){:width="15" height="15"} triple line menu to navigate to the **Patients** module. Here you will be able to filter by:

-   Patient name
    -   includes age, sex at birth, and DOB
-   Care team
    -   displayed as Name (Role)
-   Facility name

You can alphabetically sort the following columns:

-   Patient
-   Facilities
-   Last Seen
    -   Date reflects the date of the most recent visit note (excludes notes like Chart Review).

Use the ![mceclip0.png](/assets/images/patients-module/edit-button.png){:width="21" height="22"} edit button in the Protocol Column to change which Protocols are displayed.
