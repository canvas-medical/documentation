This is a protocol that is intended to show up on every patient's chart and contains useful patient links for the clinical user.

[**Hyperlink Helpers code** ](https://github.com/canvas-medical/open-source-sdk/blob/main/canvas_workflow_helpers/protocols/hyperlink_helpers.py)

Once uploaded, each patient will have an ever-present protocol card with the dynamically generated links.
