## Overview

Forms are a key part of the Patient Portal experience.
They allow developers to dynamically display questionnaires to patients based on various criteria
and optionally create a Questionnaire Command within a Note.
Since these effects are evaluated on every page load, itâ€™s essential to ensure that only the appropriate forms are
shown.

## Structure

A Form Result effect consists of the following properties:

- **questionnaire_id**: The unique identifier for the Questionnaire.
- **create_command**: A boolean flag that, when set to `True`, creates a Questionnaire Command within a Note.
- **note_id**: Optionally associates the effect with an existing Note.

These properties ensure that the effect integrates seamlessly with the rest of the Canvas SDK.
