Care Modeling: Developing and Updating Care Model over Time
The Canvas Platform is the set of tools we provide to our customers for developing and updating your care model (tools for care modeling)
## The Canvas Workflow Kit
The Canvas Workflow Kit was designed to surface clinical guidance based on changes within the system through Protocols. Protocols are structured - detect changes and render guidance. 

The structure of Protocols can be limiting. 

Plugins - allow much more granular control, customize many more aspects of Canvas
Expansion of the capabilities
Python packages vs single sandboxed limited python file
Holistic customization of Canvas

Should I use the workflow kit or Plugins

Workflow kit vs Plugins
Moving toward plugins 
Only use the workflow kit if the plugins dont support what you need
Talk to support if plugins dont support your use case.
We will roll out additional use cases based on customer input
Use protocols if you can't wait - time will be needed to refactor
CQMs - continue with plugins
