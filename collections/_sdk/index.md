## Care Modeling in Action
To help customers implement and iterate on their care model in Canvas, we created the Canvas SDK. Through the Canvas SDK, customers are able to customize and extend the capabilities of Canvas by control over the design of care delivery workflows and how they manifest within Canvas inclusive of how Canvas interacts with other systems through the Canvas FHIR API.

The Canvas SDK allows for the development of plugins that listen for events
and respond with one or more effects on the system. Use plugins to make
recommendations, generate tasks, re-order or enrich search results, or even
create a co-pilot for charting.


## Getting Started
A guide for developing your first plugin can be found [here](/guides/your-first-plugin).

The Canvas SDK and related tooling is open source. Check out the repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/canvas-medical/canvas-plugins).

Get help, request help, suggest future capabilities, or otherwise interact with the Canvas Care Modeling Community [here](https://github.com/canvas-medical/canvas-plugins/discussions).
