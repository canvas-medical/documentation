# Events Handbook {#quickstart-event-handbook}

Events are used throughout the Canvas Core as the way to interact and
modify behaviour of the rest of the system.

This Handbook aims to give you a list and small description of all
events dispatched by our APIs.

For more information about events and how to use them, check their
documentation page `here <events>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
