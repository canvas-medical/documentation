### Customize Search Results
Canvas's search functions are typically used dozens of times in a single patient interaction. Navigating through the thousands of options within a dropdown can be a daunting task for a clinician. Keywords and quickpicks can help improve the experience, but their impact is often limited. Our plugins allow you to add your own complex logic to help surface the right options, with the right context, at the right time. We currently support altering our condition search results through the Plugins beta, and will continue to expand this offering throughout the platform. 

{% tabs CSR %}
{% tab CSR Developers %}
If your super users identify a way to optimize the current condition search results for your care model, you can leverage a plugin to alter the results as desired. To paricipate in the beta, please reach out to product@canvasmedical.com to get set up. 

After following the quickstart guide...
