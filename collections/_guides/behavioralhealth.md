Canvas is purpose built to accommodate every stage and scale for care delivery organization such as yours. This is absolutely true for behavioral health. Canvas can meet your ever-evolving needs, whether youâ€™re building a cash-pay digital mental health clinic, an evidence-based treatment program targeting Medicare/Medicaid, or any meaningful behavioral health care model in between. This guide applies our Care Modeling framework to Behavioral Health and provides relevant examples of how to employ various Canvas capabilities for each of the seven elements of Care Modeling.   

### **Patient Sourcing and Intake**

#### Creating your Patient Profiles

Whether you are **sourcing patients** from your direct-to-consumer site, getting patient lists through a payer relationship and/or leveraging a CRM, **our FHIR API will enable you to create and update your patient profiles within Canvas** with all of the necessary demographic information to get started. The endpoints listed below are the most commonly utilized to do so.


[**`Patient:`**](https://main.d298pum72820gn.amplifyapp.com/api/patient/) The create and update endpoints allow you to sync the patient's demographic data, including addresses, contact methods, patient preferences, patient contacts, and more. 

#### Surfacing custom data points using Banner Protocols
The `identifier` attribute is a great place to store unique identifiers and additional data for that patient that does not fit elsewhere. 

Although identifiers added through the API do not display in the Canvas UI by default, this Banner Alert Protocol can be used to display the values. You can update both [`alertplacement` and `alertintent`](https://docs.canvasmedical.com/docs/banner-alerts-for-contacts#alertplacement) as needed. 

```

    STATUS_SATISFIED

                result.add_narrative(
                    'Placeholder text'
                )
            else:
                result.status = STATUS_DUE
                result.due_in = -1
                result.add_narrative(
                    f'{self.patient.first_name} has external identifer(s)'
                )
                external_identifiers = self.patient.patient["externalIdentifiers"]
                for external_identifier in external_identifiers:
                    result.recommendations.append(
                        BannerAlertIntervention(
                            narrative=(f"{external_identifier['system']}: 
                            {external_identifier['value']}"),
                            placement=['profile'],
                            intent='info')
                        )
        return result     
```



**`Coverage:`** Whether you are billing to commercial insurance plans, or need to add custom employer-based coverages, the Coverage endpoint can be leveraged to add a Patient's coverage information. We populate the [initial list of availble insurers](https://www.claim.md/payer_list.html) through our integration with ClaimMD. Additional coverage options such as employee programs can be added and updated following [these steps](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062281054-Managing-Insurers). The ID associated with each insurer is needed to create the coverage throught the API. 


**`Consent:`** Consents also have to be [configured](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5524511564947-Patient-Consents) before they can be added through the API. The `ConsentCoding` cannot be changed once created, so make sure to configure your consents with that in mind. In addition to recording the consent, you can attach a PDF version using the `sourceAttachment` attribute. 

#### Incorporating patient collected data with Questionnaires

Leading up to a scheduled appointment, you can streamline **patient intake** by writing patient data that has been collected through your patient application to Canvas with our FHIR API. 


**`QuestionnaireResponse Create:`** The `QuestionnaireResponse` endpoint can be used to capture structured data through the use of custom forms. Questionnaires must first be [configured](https://main.d298pum72820gn.amplifyapp.com/documentation/ConfiguringQuestionnaires/) in your Canvas instance. Your team can utilize our no-code google sheet template to build, update, and load questionnaires into your Canvas instance.

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTIe3s2zh0FAZMaIxaxg2EQ5x7ot4U4iSX95tLNClkNvQ4LQAr_qZm6b9nmdG68xDf4NdeNqEIvKlpo/pubhtml?gid=2051129171&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" width=800px height=600px ></iframe>

They are designed to be code-backed to ensure that you can interact with them programatically. Make sure to coordinate across your Clinical Operations and Engineering, Product, & Design (EPD) teams to set them up with unique codes, using our supported code systems. We do offer some pre-built questionnaires, including many common behavioral health assessments such as the PHQ-9 shown above.<Br>

To load this PHQ-9 questionniare into your sandbox, navigate to Settings>Practice>Questionnaire Loader or to: https://{sandboxname}-preview.canvasmedical.com/admin/api/questionnaireloader/ and paste in the following:<br> 


**Google Sheet ID:** 1RIYAvyp62EOlQ6DPRV4tRPyca8xgEbg4z2vGo_EEhT4<br>
**Google Sheet tab name:** ques-PHQ9-all<br>


You may want your patients to complete these assessments, or your custom built workflows, prior to their visit. Canvas Notes are meant to be collaborative and authored by multiple people, **including the patient**. When adding patient-collected data you can set the `author` attribute to patient/{patientkey}. Doing so will then be visible within the Command history tooltip in the Note.<br>

The `QuestionnaireResponse` endpoint allows you to **specify the encounter** you would like to add it to. One thing to note is that an encounter is only generated once an appointment is checked in. If you would like to add your questionnaire to the Encounter being used by your clinicians, you can use a notification protocol to act as a webhook. The Encounter `change_type` allows you to respond to the act of checking in an appointment and send a payload that includes the encounter ID needed for the `QuestionnaireResponse` Create api call. 

```
Protocol: Respond to check in and send encounter ID (or use API to get it if its not availble 
in the protocol input)

```

#### Canvas + Zus ðŸ”± 

If you find that your care team is spending countless hours hunting down your patient's historical records and converting them to structured data, the **Canvas + Zus integration** may be a game changer.  Clinicians can leverage the Zus Aggregated Profile (ZAP) to insert relevant patient data (historical medications, conditions, labs, and encounters sourced from various HIEs and proprietary data networks) directly into Canvas profiles in actionable ways. Learn more about our Partner ship with Zus [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/canvas-medical-and-zus-announce-strategic-product-partnership-redefining-the-speed-and-effectiveness-of-collaborative-development-in-healthtech-301736901.html) . 

### **Ongoing Interaction Modes and Utilization Policies**

#### Configure Canvas to support your scheduling needs

Releasing [**configurable Note Types**](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6623684024083-Note-Types-) was tightly aligned with our strategy shift away from focusing on primary care. The differentiated care models of our customers often include all types of patient interactions, including in-person visits, telehealth, and asynchronous encounters. You can configure your note types to fit your behavioral health offering by creating custom note types and codes, or using an established system such as the [LOINCÂ®](https://loinc.org/LG41826-5) codes listed below. <br><br>
18776-5	Plan of care note <br>
28627-8	Psychiatry Progress note <br>
28628-6	Psychiatry Note<br>
28635-1	Psychiatry Initial evaluation note<br>

[**Availabilty in Canvas**](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/knowledge/articles/360058400553/en-us?brand_id=360005403014&return_to=%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F360058400553) is managed through and integration with Google Calendar. 

#### Manage your schedules with the Canvas API
Once your availabilty has been set, you can use the `schedule` and `slot` search endpoints to find provider availability.

Schedule appointments using the `appointment` endpoint 

Your providers may be part time or juggling both clinical hours and internal meetings. Syncing clinical and administrative calendars is often a must. You can use the notification protocol to know when and appointment has been created or updated in Canvas and use it to write that appointment to your administrative calendars. With this you can control what info is shared, whether you have a BAA with Google and can write PHI, or just need to block time. You can also block time in Canvas through the API by writing other events
