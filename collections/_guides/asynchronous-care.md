title: "Asynchronous Care"
guide_for: 
---

Async care can happen in various ways, and while it‚Äôs not a new model of care delivery, it has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. The guide below outlines how you can surface patient completed questionnaires for review by your care team. It also offers suggestions on how you can leverage the structured data collected to surface recommendations based on your care model.
<br>

## What you'll learn
In this guide, you will learn how to address asynchronous patient requests by completing the following steps
1. Write patient collected data using Questionnaires
2. Write tasks to create a worklist in Canvas
3. Surface recommendations based on Questionnaire responses
<br>

### 1. Write patient collected data using Questionnaires

In order to evaluate a patient asynchronously, you will need to collect all of the necessary inputs (histories, symptoms, preferences, etc.) so that your clinicians have the full picture when making treatment decisions. Some of the data may map to our existing write endpoints and anything that may not fit elsewhere can be added through a Questionnaire. Questionnaires are a great way to extend the Canvas data model as they are fully configurable and designed to be code-backed.

<b>I. Super Users ü¶∏:</b> Once you design and finalize the your intake forms, you will need to build and upload them as Questionnaires in Canvas. Follow [these instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/questionnaires/) to do so. <br><br>
<b>II. Developers üë®‚Äçüíª:</b> Canvas does not offer a patient experience for completing Questionnaires. You will need to extend Canvas by building the patient facing front end (or leveraging a partner to build it for you). Once the data has been captured within your workflow, you can leverage our [FHIR QuestionnaireResponse Create endpoint]({{site.baseurl}}/api/questionnaireresponse/)to surface the responses in Canvas. Without specificying an Encounter reference, the completed Questionnaire Command will be added to a Data Import Note in the patient's Timeline. 

{% include alert.html type="info" content="Data Import notes are automatically locked and cannot be updated by your clinicians in the application. Any associated documentation will need to be added in a new Note." %}

### 2. Write tasks to create a worklist in Canvas

The task panel is a great tool to organize work to be done. After your patients complete your online intake forms, you can leverage Tasks in Canvas to alert your team that they are ready for review.

<br>
<b>I. Super Users ü¶∏:</b> You will need to configure Teams and Task Labels in Canvas. 

 - [Teams]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/teams/) are intended to group work. You may want to group specialty providers together ( `Dermatology Providers`), or set up teams that support certain times of the day (`After Hours Support`). 
 - [Task Labels]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/task-labels/) are meant to help organize tasks and are helpful as filters within the task panel. You may need to indicate that a patient should be treated as priority and a label would be a way to do that.

<b>II. Developers üë®‚Äçüíª: </b> You can assign tasks to both indivduals and/or team, and assign labels using the [FHIR Task Create and Update]({{site.baseurl}}/api/task/) endpoints. 

- If assigning to an individual, add a practitiioner reference in the owner attribute. 
- Teams are mapped to the FHIR Group resource. Assign the Task to a Team using the Task group extension. Use the [FHIR Group Search]({{site.baseurl}}/api/group/) to find the necessary group ID. 
- Labels do not have to exist in your admin settings in order to be added through the API, however, the custom colors will only show if they have been assigned in admin. 

<b>III. Super Users ü¶∏</b> After the tasks have been created in Canvas, use the filters to create your worklists. You can bookmark the filtered views to save them. The page default will show tasks assigned to `Me or my teams`. The tasks assigned to your teams only show if they are not also assigned to an individual (unclaimed). If a new task comes in, you can assign it to yourself to claim it, removing it from the view of others.

### 3. Surface recommendations based on Questionnaire responses
Async workflows may need to support a high volume of patients. Protocols are a great way to surface best practice recommendations to your treating providers so that they can work through their queues efficiently. 

<b>I. Super Users ü¶∏:</b> Use the framework below to define how your questionnaire responses should drive recommendations. 

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![Protocol framework](/assets/images/protocol-framework.png){:width="60%"}
{: refdef}

An example of this would be building a protocol that surfaces relevant oral contraceptive options after a patient submits a questionnaire indicating their preference for skipping their cycles. The protocol can include prefilled commands as suggestions, making it easy for the clinican to follow care guidelines and quickly add orders or documentation to their note.

<br>
<br>
<b>II. Developers üë®‚Äçüíª: </b> The interview [change type]({{site.baseurl}}/sdk/change-types/) allows you to recompute a protocol after a questionnaire is recorded (either in the UI or through the API). This protocol recommends diagnosing certain conditions based on questionnaire responses, and the recommendations have one-click commands for inserting the conditions into a Canvas note.
