Something quick about Behavioral Health

## Launching your Behavioral Health Care Model: Questions to Ask
The world is facing a mental health crisis and you want to help tackle it ðŸ™Œ. With recent cultural changes, scientific and technological advancements, improved data sharing, and a shift towards consumerism, the behavioral health space is prime for disruption.  To be successful and drive value, youâ€™ll need to differentiate on your care model. Youâ€™ll likely start by asking the questions outlined below. Once youâ€™ve settled on a direction for each, weâ€™ve outlined recommended next steps to get started. <br> <br> 

### Diagnostic Range and Inputs
**What problem and/or population are we addressing?**
<br>  
What is your target population? Does your care model support a broad range of mental health concerns for all genders and ages (everything in the DSM), or are you focused on adolescents suffering from eating disorders? Recognizing your Diagnostic Range is a critical starting point, as it informs the complexity of your healthcare practice. After defining your target population you may want to: 
<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Build and load Behavioral Health [Questionnaires](/guides/bh-configuration/#questionnaires) in order to collect the necessary data to inform your clinical decision making<br>
ðŸ‘‰ [Customize Search Results](/guides/customize-search-results) to only surface behavioral health ICD-10 codes in the diagnose command.     
<br>
### Scope of Interventions & Safety Framework
**How will we treat our patients?**
<br>
Next youâ€™ll need to determine what services and treatments you plan to offer. As your Scope of Interventions broadens - and your care model gets more complex - you will also need to apply more rigor in your safety framework.
<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Assign permissions to [roles](/documentation/roles) so that team members can perform the duties of their role. <br>
ðŸ‘‰ [Build a safety framework](/guides/build-a-safety-framework) to support evidence-based workflows.
<br><br>
### Care Team Composition and Sourcing
**What is the makeup of our Care Team?**
<br> 
As the demand for behavioral health services continues to rise, various factors, including an aging workforce, recruitment and retention challenges, geographic disparities, and financial barriers, have contributed to the scarcity of providers. As a result, fewer than half of people with a mental illness were able to access timely care in 2021. Innovating on the makeup of your care team can help to address this shortage and set you apart. Canvas was built to support interdisciplinary care teams that take advantage of team membersâ€™ strengths, bring in more assistive clinical workers, and allow everybody to operate at the top of their license.

ðŸ‘‰ Customize Canvas to support [team-based care](guides/team-based-care) for your multidisciplinary behavioral health team
<br><br>
### Patient Sourcing & Intake
**How will we acquire patients?**
<br>
Strategy around how you source and onboard new patients (or clients) is necessary to successfully attract and connect with individuals in need of mental health services, establish a positive first impression, gather comprehensive patient information, and prioritize the well-being and safety of patients throughout their care journey.<br>

ðŸ‘‰ [Optimize intake](guides/optimize-intake) to provide a seamless digital experience for your patients. 
<br><br>
### Ongoing Interaction Modes & Utilization Policies
**How will we interact with our patients/clients?**
<br>
Understanding and effectively managing interaction modes in your behavioral healthcare model is crucial to providing a seamless and efficient patient experience. Implementing interconnected synchronous and asynchronous communication channels, guided by well-structured Utilization Policies, can streamline your operations, enhance patient engagement, and ultimately improve care outcomes.<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Set up external scheduling <br>
ðŸ‘‰ patient messagaing <br>
ðŸ‘‰ asynchronous care 
<br><br>
### Content and Automation
**How can we drive efficiency in our workflows?**
<br>
In the context of care modeling, content falls into two buckets: patient-facing content and care team-facing content. Once the content is defined, building in automation in the form of templates, macros, and guidance is crucial to effectively scale. <br><br>
To support your clinicians in delivering high quality care, you can: <br>

ðŸ‘‰ Create automations to accelerate documentation<br>
ðŸ‘‰ Develop recommendations to promote standards of care and alert clinicians of potential safety concerns.
<br><br>
### Pricing and Payments
**How will we get paid?** 
<br>
Although listed last, payment should not be an afterthought. Incentives are important and your care model will undoubtedly be influenced by your payment model. We built our fully integrated Revenue module to support all models, including direct-to-consumer (D2C), self-insured employers (SIE), fee-for-service reimbursement (FFS), and/or value-based contracting (VBC).To get paid, you may need to:<br>

ðŸ‘‰ Set up your instance to document and charge for the services you provide<br>
ðŸ‘‰ Use our API to automate your revenue cycle<br>

The examples below are only a starting point to give you some ideas of how you could leverage Canvasâ€™s capabilities. Youâ€™ll find that weâ€™ve barely scratched the surface and the opportunities are endless as you navigate through your care modeling journey.
