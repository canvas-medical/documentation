If you are already a customer of Canvas, you will have a designated instance to access our API and SDK. You may skip straight to our [Getting Started With the Canvas FHIR API docs](/api/)  or  our [SDK Quickstart](/sdk/sdk-quickstart) 

If you are interested in Canvas, we offer sandbox environments for you to get a little taste of what Canvas has to offer. You can [contact us to create a Canvas account](https://www.canvasmedical.com/contact). 

We'll then start building your sandbox. While you're waiting, explore the documentation. Once the sandbox is ready, you'll receive login credentials.

You can now navigate to `<sandbox-name>.preview.canvasmedical.com` to access your development sandbox.

With this sandbox you can now have a Bearer Token on your Dashboard that will give you access to using our FHIR API and SDK:
