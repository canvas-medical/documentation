## Surface Risk Adjustment Scores when Searching Conditions

Risk adjustment is a way to help make sure doctors and other health providers are paid fairly for the people they treat – providers get paid more for patients who have more health problems than for healthy patients who may not need as many services.

HCC coding can make the difference between having an incomplete picture of your patients’ health or a full view of the complexity of chronic conditions. An accurate picture enables a health system to stay competitive by fully accounting for the cost of patient care. These expenses will have an impact on your benchmark, creating a level playing field for calculating ACO cost savings. With accurate HCC coding, a healthcare organization is demonstrating the value of the care they deliver and earning shared savings. It also allows Bellin to know and manage populations, not just individual patients.
