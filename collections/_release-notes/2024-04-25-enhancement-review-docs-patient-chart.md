The PDF view functionality on a patientâ€™s chart has been reinstated, for which a new tab opens for viewing labs, imaging, specialist consult, and uncategorized clinical documents. The `Review` and `View` buttons have been added for seamless review of these documents as a pop-up on the patient chart.
