Procedure codes and charges can be linked to questionnaire responses if the code system is set to CPT. We have added the ability to also include modifiers. When creating questionnaires, including PE, ROS, and structured assessments, you can include a modifier using the following format as the code: `99215-25`. Doing so will drop the modifier to the billing footer and claim.
