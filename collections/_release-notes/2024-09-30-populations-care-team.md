We have updated the populations module to allow users to filter patients based on care team membership. Weâ€™ve also moved Campaigns to a standalone page. Please reach out to support if you would like the [populations](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405414136595-Population-Module) module enabled in your environment.
