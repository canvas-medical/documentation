This work fixes a bug that was affecting the order in which conditions are displayed in the patient summary. Now, by default, conditions will be sorted by last assessed to first assessed. This way users can quickly identify which conditions may be stale or need to be addressed (those at the bottom). Users can temporarily change the sort to be alphabetical using the slider icon.
