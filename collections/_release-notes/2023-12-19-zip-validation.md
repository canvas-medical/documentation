Validation for US postal codes has been incorporated into the Organization, Practice Location, and Staff address forms when the country is set to `US`. This validation ensures that the entered US Postal code follows the correct format: either `12345` or `12345-1234`. If the user specifies any country other than the United States, the validation process will be bypassed.
