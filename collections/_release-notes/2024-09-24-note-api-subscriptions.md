Updates made via the [Note API](/api/note) can now be reflected in the timeline without refreshing the page. Users will see newly added notes appear if they are within their view and note state change events will result in the note collapsing (ULK” → “LKD) or expanding (LKD” → “ULK). Please reach out to product@canvasmedical.com if you would like to enable this feature.
