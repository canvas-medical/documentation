Migrated commands now support the following: 

- Carry forward the last committed response. This option will pull in the latest record from the database across all users. This functionality is compatible moving forward. You may not be able to pull in responses from our legacy commands.
- Add partially completed commands to automations.
- Committed commands may be truncated to preserve space in the note. Click on the command header to expand the full content. 

Users can access these workflows using the triple dot menu associated with the command, which is now present before clicking record. Currently, the only command available GA is **plan**. These enhancements will be available for the [newly released commands](/product-updates/commands-module/){:target="_blank"} moving forward (when appropriate).
