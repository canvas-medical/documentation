Earlier this year, Canvas deployed permalinks. These are direct links to Canvas objects (notes, commands, PDFs and more) that can be added to tasks. We received feedback from users that these links were useful, and that it would be helpful to be able to get a permalink outside of the context of a task. One use case is to share a link to a specific note with a colleague, via Canvas chat or another chat application like Slack. As a result we have added an option "copy link" to the kebab (triple dot) menu of the note. This option will add a permalink to the note to the user's clipboard.
