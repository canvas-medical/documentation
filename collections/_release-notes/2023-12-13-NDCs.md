Canvas has a mapping from prescribed medications like “Amoxicillin 500mg tablet” to an NDC code. This NDC code is sent to the pharmacy with prescriptions. In some cases, the NDC code was not respecting brand vs generic distinctions. Now the mapping has been updated so that, wherever, possible, the NDC will correctly reflect whether the selected medication was brand or generic. Note that in some cases this is not possible, for example if a the generic medication name is selected but the medication is still on patent and there is no generic NDC yet.
