In the patient chart, there is a chart tab that can be accessed from the top right which shows active protocols. There is a badge on that chart tab which shows the number of active protocols. Previously, this badge count only counted the number of active protocols with recommendations. Now it will show the count of all active protocols with a protocol card, even if there is no recommendation. This is more intuitive - the user should expect the number displayed to be equal to the number of protocol cards they see when they click on the tab.
