Users can now fax lab requisitions after they have been saved or sent electronically via Health. Selecting `Fax lab requisition` from the triple dot menu on the command will bring up our faxing modal, which allows users to specify where the order should be sent and complete the cover sheet fields if covers sheets are enabled in your instance. The status of the outbound fax can be tracked in your Sfax portal.
