title: Update to Reload Health Gorilla Compendia

We have made an performance enhancement to the `reload_compendium` when it reaches out to Health Gorilla (HG) for an updated Lab’s compendium. We have also reduced the job to run on a weekly basis as compared to a daily basis due to HG’s compendium update cadency. Canvas Support will still have the ability to run this sync manually if HG updates the compendium more often.
