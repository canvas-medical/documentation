Users will be able to inactivate practice locations through admin settings. Once a practice location has been marked as inactive it will be removed from UI selection drop downs such as note headers, letter templates, message templates, appointment scheduling, and schedule view. If an inactive practice location had been used in past notes, appointments letter, and messages, it will be displayed with an (inactive) label after the practice location name. Practice locations cannot be saved as inactive if there are any future appointments for those locations, appointments must first be updated or removed.
