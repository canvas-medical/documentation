title: Associated Patient and Provider Data Updated on Claims

When the `push charges` button is utilized on a billable note, the associated patient and provider data to that claim will be automatically updated so that the latest version of an unlocked note will have the updated information for the patient and provider. This information includes patient demographics, coverage data, and provider admin staff page values. Additionally, if users want a locked note to reflect updated patient and provider information, a user needs to unlock and re-lock the note to automatically update this information on the claim. Claims associated to a locked note will not have patient and provider information automatically update, to prevent unwanted changes to these claims.
