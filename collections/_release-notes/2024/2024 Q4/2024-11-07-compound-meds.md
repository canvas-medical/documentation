We are excited to announce the new feature that allows users to [create compound medications](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/5128727084-managing-medication-commands#compound-medications-67) and electronically send prescriptions to pharmacies partnered with Surescripts. This feature supports both controlled and non-controlled substances, enhancing your prescribing capabilities.  This new functionality requires our Prescribe and Refill SDK command to be enabled.   Please reach out to [Canvas Support](https://portal.usepylon.com/canvas-medical/forms/standard) if youâ€™d like to utilize this new feature.
