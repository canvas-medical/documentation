The Canvas Note API now fully supports actions for checking in and locking notes.

- **Check-In Action**: Transition a note from BKD (Booked), NSW (No-showed), or RVT (Reverted) to CVD (Converted), mirroring the note check-in process in the UI.

- **Lock Action**: When transitioning a note to LKD (Locked) all associated actions related to the encounter and claim now behave as they do when locking a note through the UI
