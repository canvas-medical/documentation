We've update how commands load within notes on the timeline. Rather than preloading commands for all open and visible notes, we now load them as the user scrolls through the timeline. This speeds up initial chart load and allows users to start charting much faster. Malformed commands will also now show an error in the note body, whereas they previously were presented as loading gray boxes.
