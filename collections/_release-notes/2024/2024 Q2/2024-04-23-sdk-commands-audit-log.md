You can now see access an audit history of SDK commands in the command triple dot menu. We have chosen to move away from the existing tooltip (available on hover) for SDK commands in order to have more space to display additional data. We have added timestamps for some actions now and have plans to continue to expand on the level of detail within the audit trail in the future.
