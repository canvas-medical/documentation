We have updated the populations module to allow users to filter patients based on care team membership. Weâ€™ve also moved Campaigns to a standalone page. Please reach out to support if you would like the [populations](https://canvas-medical.help.usepylon.com/articles/3316466244-population-module) module enabled in your environment.
