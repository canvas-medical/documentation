We've updated the commit button on the SDK lab order, prescribe, and refill, and adjust prescription commands to a split button. Now, there are two disctinct clickable areas. Clicking the main button will commit the command instantly (sending or saving the order), while the dropdown lets you choose alternative actions. The action will always default to send if an electronic lab or pharmacy is chosen.
