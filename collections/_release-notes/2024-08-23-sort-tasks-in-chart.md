Tasks within a patient chart are, by default, sorted by due date in ascending order. To help users navigate both open and closed tasks more easily, we have added the ability to change the sorting order and sort by either the creation date or the last modified date. The 'last modified' option currently applies only to updates made to the task model, which does not reflect changes to task comments.
