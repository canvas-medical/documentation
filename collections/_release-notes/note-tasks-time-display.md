title: Adjustment to Chart Timeline Headers and Tasks Display Times
layout: productupdates

In order to remove user confusion when reviewing displayed time on the patient chart and within tasks, we have adjusted how time is displayed for user. 

- On letters, messages, and note headers: Users will now see the following format `Day of week, MM/DD/YY HH:MM AM user-time-zone`. This should provide clarity on when a letter, message, and note were created on a patient chart.
- On task created header and task activities: Users will now see the following format `Day of week, MM/DD/YY HH:MM AM user-time-zone`. This should provide clarity on when tasks were created and when activities took place within a task. The same will be true on the task panel . 
- On task due dates: Users will now see the following format `Day of week, MM/DD/YY`. This should provide clarity on what day a task is due.
