We have updated `ReasonForVisitSettingCoding` to be externally identifiable and added it to the Data Module. We have also updated the RFV effect and interpreter to allow the usage of `ReasonForVisitSettingCoding` within the command and added validations to ensure the values passed to the coding field are valid.
