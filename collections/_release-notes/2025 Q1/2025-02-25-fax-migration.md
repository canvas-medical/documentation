Canvas has implemented a new faxing integration with Documo, which will enhance the reliability and tracking of outbound faxes. This integration includes:

- Improved transmission speeds
- Enhanced reporting and audit tracking

**Status Audit Modal for Commands and Notes (Documo Only)**

Weâ€™ve introduced a new fax status audit modal for:

- Command-based faxes (e.g., refer, imaging, and lab orders)
- Note-based faxes

This enhancement provides greater visibility into fax transmission statuses, making it easier to track the progress and troubleshoot issues.

**Current Sfax customers will be gradually transitioned to Documo**

Expect direct contact from the Canvas Customer Experience team to coordinate your migration. There will be no immediate impact on your faxing operations during this transition.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please reach out to Canvas Support.
