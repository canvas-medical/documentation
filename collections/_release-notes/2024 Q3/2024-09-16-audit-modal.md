The audit modal associated with migrated commands will now show all edits. Users can also revert to previous versions of the commmand prior to being committed. Each line item in the history can be expanded to view the edits made in the saved version and selecting revert will update the command to that previous version. The view of questionnaire edits is currently limited to the user and timestamp. Future work will ensure details are present for all commands.
