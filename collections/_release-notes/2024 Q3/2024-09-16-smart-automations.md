We've created logic within automations to update commands based on patient details. If an automation that includes `diagnose` is used on a patient who has been previously diagnosed with the same condition, it will automatically update to `assess` instead. Please reach out to **product@canvasmedical.com** if you are interested in testing this new automation logic.
