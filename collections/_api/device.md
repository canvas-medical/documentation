### Creating Devices for a Patient

To learn how to create a device resource for a patient, see this [Zendesk article](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413855312147-Implantable-Device-List). It currently does not display on the Canvas UI, however it will be stored within the Canvas database and can be accessed via Device Read/Search. In order to generate the `type` attribute, a device code must be created and linked to the device via the admin settings on Canvas.
