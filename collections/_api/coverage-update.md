Coverage Update resembles [Coverage Create](ref:coverage-create) with a few exceptions. These exceptions are outlined below: 

- If any attribute that is not required is omitted that is currently set in Canvas's database, that attribute's value will be overwritten to be empty.
- The `id` field is used to identify the coverage we are updating.
