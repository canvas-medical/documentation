## Prescribing a Medication in Canvas

A FHIR medication request correlates to using the [prescribe command](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063523313-Prescribing-a-Medication), or [refill command](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057482354-Refill-Medications). Any adjustments made via the [adjust prescription command](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061706154-Adjust-an-Existing-Medication) will be reflected.
