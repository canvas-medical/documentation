Scroll down and select "**Staff**" under the Practice header.

Select any Staff member listed. If you've never created a new Staff member, the only person listed here will be the person who first created your instance.

The "Key" listed is that staff member's **Practitioner ID**. You can use this for any API Request that may require a Practitioner ID.
