## Creating an Encounter in Canvas

An encounter is associated with some of our notes in Canvas. For our default base notes, an encounter will be created with these note type:
- Lab visit
- Phone visit
- Telehealth visit
- Office visit
- Home Visit
- In-patient Visit

Appointment Notes once checked in that are for the above visit types will be converted to an encounter. 
See this[ Zendesk article](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056430014-Appointments) for how to schedule an appointment. 

With our [Configurable Note Types Feature](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6623684024083) all custom note types will be associated with an encounter by default.
