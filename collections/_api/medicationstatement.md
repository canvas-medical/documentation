### Creating a Medication Statement in Canvas

There are two ways to create a FHIR medication statement. The first is to use the medication statement command, see this [Zendesk article](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004007942-Documenting-a-Historical-Medication). Other FHIR medication statements can be derived from a FHIR medication request using the [prescribe command](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063523313-Prescribing-a-Medication), or [refill command](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057482354-Refill-Medications). Any adjustments made via the [adjust prescription command](https://canvas-medical.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061706154-Adjust-an-Existing-Medication) will be reflected.
