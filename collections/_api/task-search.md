## Status Mapping

Since Canvas only supports 3 statuses, the mapping back to FHIR is as follows:
[block:parameters]
{
  "data": {
    "h-0": "Canvas Status",
    "h-1": "FHIR Status",
    "0-0": "open",
    "0-1": "requested",
    "1-0": "completed",
    "1-1": "completed",
    "2-0": "closed",
    "2-1": "cancelled"
  },
  "cols": 2,
  "rows": 3
}
[/block]
