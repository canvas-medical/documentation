Canvas Medical's FHIR API adheres to the [FHIR R4 specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).

We also maintain a Postman Collection that allows easy access to making requests to our FHIR API Endpoints. We highly encourage you to fork our collection as it is maintained by our developers on a daily basis.

# Who can access this API?
While we intend to make portions of this API accessible to third-parties in the near future (with patient authorization), it is currently limited to practices and organizations utilizing Canvas Medical as their EHR as well as their trusted partners.
