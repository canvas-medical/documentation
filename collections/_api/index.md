Canvas Medical's FHIR API adheres to the [FHIR R4 specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).



There is a Postman Collection that allows easy access to making requests to Canvas FHIR API Endpoints. Canvas recommends forking the collection as it is maintained by our developers on a daily basis.

**NOTE:** By default, Postman syncs requests and their responses to their servers, which makes the tool unsuitable for dealing with PHI. Please use the Postman collection as a way to get started quickly in a development environment only. In the future, we will provide a similar resource in a format suited for a tool that does not store data on a remote server.

## Who can access this API?
While Canvas intends to make portions of this API accessible to third-parties in the near future (with patient authorization), it is currently limited to practices and organizations utilizing Canvas Medical as their EHR as well as their trusted partners.
