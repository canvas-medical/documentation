Canvas Medical's FHIR API adheres to the [FHIR R4 specification](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).

We also maintain a Postman Collection that allows easy access to making requests to our FHIR API Endpoints. We highly encourage you to fork our collection as it is maintained by our developers on a daily basis.
[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/16792990-3010816d-4e70-4f3d-8ba4-248d8793f915?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D16792990-3010816d-4e70-4f3d-8ba4-248d8793f915%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D6caafc1e-b842-4426-ae66-730fac86ed3e)

# Who can access this API?
While we intend to make portions of this API accessible to third-parties in the near future (with patient authorization), it is currently limited to practices and organizations utilizing Canvas Medical as their EHR as well as their trusted partners.
